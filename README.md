# Predict Boston Housing Prices

Analyzing and predict Boston housing prices using data scraped from Trulia using advanced regression models. I will go in depth for all the processes of this project: using `Beautiful Soup` to scrape data, analyzing and comparing different regression models (`Linear`, `Lasso`, `Random Forest`, `XGBoost`), and building an API using `Flask`.

## Background and Motivation

Since I have done a simple regression model with my previous project (["GDP_Fertility_Mortality_Relation"](https://github.com/chilam27/GDP_Fertility_Mortality_Relation/edit/master/README.md)), I wanted to improve my skill sets and prediction's accuracy even more. In this project, I had three main focuses:
1. Learn how to scrape website with Python.
2. Understand the importance of Exploratory Data Analysis and how it contributes to the outcome.
3. Introduce productionization stage into my project.

One more improvement I applied for this project is using different regression models and improved its performance by fine tunning the parameters using `GridSearchCV`.
